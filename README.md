# Kubernetes Cluster

Project contains two folders:
- local-cluster ---> Is based on local cluster infrastructure, based on hypervisor like Virtual Box, of course used K8S, Docker, Ansible, and tools from Hashicorp like Vagrant and Terraform.
- AWS-cluster ---> Is based on Amazon Web Service as part of AWS Academy and access was granted by my university and faculty. Could be also used other provider like GCP or Azure.
